Infinite space to explore with a space ship on a HTML5 Canvas.
The idea is to develope this into a game like direction.
The ultimate goal is making it multi player.


## TODO

* [ ] Separate update and render operations and optimize rendering 
* [ ] Clean up code and refactor it into proper modern js
* [ ] Fix stars and add parallax effect
* [ ] ~~Improve planet generation~~ Design sun, planet and moon generation.
* [ ] Create proper game logic
* [ ] Pause game feature
* [ ] Pickups for ship upgrades, points etc
* [ ] Different looking planets with more variation in size
* [ ] Different looking ships
* [ ] Suns with orbiting planets (and planets with moons?)
* [ ] Asteroids with polygons
* [ ] Some other flying stuff?!
* [ ] ...

## WISHLIST!
1. [ ] Learn node.js (io.js)
2. [ ] Create multi player server
3. [ ] Implement game model at server
4. [ ] And input and rendering on the client side

## Brainstorming!
 * Weapons
   * Minigun
   * Missiles
   * Bombs
   * Mines?
 * Different ambient soundscapes based on location
 * Currency for buying and building things etc.
 * Big distances after which new areas occur
 * 3 worlds: one for mining (inhabited by neutral AI), one for building, one for fighting against the evil (inhabited by STI aka Solid State Intelligence and where player against player combat is possible)
 * Evil space worms
 * Black holes: different ones (for example: random teleport -blackhole)
 * home base which you can change and teleport to (possibly last planet that you landed on)
 * different kind of techologies: for attacking, for mining and gathering other resources, for defence, for navigation (maps etc.) and for traveling
 * Portals
 * Missiles (can only detonate themselves) and spy vehicles (invisible) _which you can control__. Defence tech for detechting spies and destroying missiles) 
 * Fuel: you cant travel forever fast --> better fuel as you build your base and dig deeper --> super tech later (teleporting etc)
 * Allianced which start building their cities from zero (newcomers can build their own or join ones already existing)
 * Different kind of alliances: anarchist, hierarchial, capitalist etc. For example: anarchist-communist alliance has no private owning of resources,
   no central leadership, can swap the space ship they fly [no-one own ships, but they can require skill which must be personally acquired], and no _central_ resources, lots of negotiance etc.
 * Different game strategies: individual vs collective and centralized against noncentralized --> both strategies are good in their own ways
 * Different kind of politics (depending on kind of the alliance) which affect the way you make decisions between co-players (discussion and voting, consensus or despotic) 
 * You can dig and find precious metals and minerals inside planets
 * Trick s: you can for example travel without fuel by using storm currents and gravity force of planets
 * UFO's: which can bring messages from unknown galaxies and new technology or sudden destruction (which can also be caused by meteorites)
 * Epic lore!!!11111
     * for history of humans and different alliances
     * already existing kindoms! which you can join (or then be an anarchist): all new players start as people who are exploring unkown frontiers which still have plenty minerals
     * history and explanations for different UFO-races, STI etc.
     * References to Tesla and Reich
 * Comm tech to inform and command own bases.
 * Technology which makes mining richer planets, which enables mining more valuable resources 
 * AI-Kindoms: you can communicate with them, trade with them, join them, be in war with them (if you are an anarchist) --> different options when communicating  
 * 
 
 * Possibility to build ships on owned planets, and to control desired ship at any time.
